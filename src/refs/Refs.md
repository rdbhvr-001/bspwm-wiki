## The Config-Ref
Below given is a curated list of awesome bspwm configs for ready reference, cloning and experimentation. **We do not advice you to blindly copy configs**, instead read them and try writing them by your own. But it is up to you whether to **use bspwm** or **build upon bspwm**.

These are some nice configurations that beginners should try learning and configuring.

<div class="admonish warn">
<p>These configs are configured by various people as per their system requirements. You may run into issues if some scripts are not compactible or optimised for your system, or if you are missing some dependencies. bspwm-wiki does not rank based on popularity, it is alphabetical order. No offense.</p>
