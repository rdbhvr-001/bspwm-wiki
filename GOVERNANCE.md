# Governance

## Project Overview

Doc741 is a **community-maintained documentation project** for the bspwm window manager.

The goal of the project is to explain bspwm concepts, behavior, and workflows in a clear and structured way, while respecting bspwm’s philosophy of simplicity, flexibility, and user control.

Doc741 is **not an official bspwm project** and does not aim to replace official documentation.  
It exists to complement it.

## Guiding Principles

The governance of Doc741 follows these principles:

- **Community-driven**: Contributions and ideas come from the bspwm community.
- **Minimal hierarchy**: Decisions are made collaboratively whenever possible.
- **Respect upstream**: bspwm’s design choices and documentation are respected.
- **Clarity over opinion**: Documentation focuses on explaining *how things work*, not enforcing personal preferences.
- **Do not over-abstract**: Stay aligned with bspwm’s DIY nature.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have demonstrated:
- Consistent, high-quality contributions
- Respectful communication
- Good understanding of bspwm concepts
- Alignment with the project’s goals

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Keeping documentation accurate and consistent
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct

## Decision Making

- Most decisions are made through **discussion in issues or pull requests**
- Contributors are encouraged to provide context, examples, and references
- When consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final call

Decisions should prioritize:
1. Accuracy

4. Alignment with bspwm behavior
