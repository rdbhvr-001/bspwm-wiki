# Doc741 — bspwm Documentation for Humans

Doc741 is a community-maintained, beginner-friendly documentation project for **bspwm**.
It focuses on explaining concepts, configuration, and practical workflows in a clear and approachable way — beyond minimal manpages.

## Why Doc741?

bspwm is powerful, but its official documentation is intentionally minimal.
Doc741 aims to bridge the gap between sparse references and real-world usage.

- Clear explanations of bspwm concepts
- Beginner-friendly structure
- Practical configuration examples and snippets
- Community knowledge collected in one place

## Who is this for?

- New bspwm users getting started for the first time
- Users migrating from i3, dwm, or other tiling window managers
- People who want to **understand bspwm**, not just copy configs
- Anyone who prefers structured explanations and examples

## Start here

If you’re new, this path works well:

1. **Introduction**
2. **bspwm concepts & tree structure**
3. **Basic configuration**
4. **Common recipes and snippets**
5. **Popular configurations for references**
## Additional learning resources

The following official and community resources complement Doc741:

- [Official bspwm documentation](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- [Arch Wiki: bspwm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bspwm)
- [Doc741 (community-maintained bspwm documentation)](https://rdbhvr-001.github.io/doc741)

> Doc741 is referenced by community bspwm configuration and documentation projects. Other popular bspwm configurations are also referenced in this documentation for gathering more ideas and knowledge about know-hows.

## 🛠 TODO

Planned additions to Doc741 include:

- [ ] References and explanations for community bspwm configurations
- [ ] Short tips and tricks for common bspwm workflows
- [ ] A dedicated query/reference page for `bspc` usage
- [ ] Example configurations for various use cases and setups

This list will evolve as the documentation grows.
