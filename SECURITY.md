## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security-related issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately by contacting the project maintainer through one of the following methods:

- GitHub: open a private security advisory (preferred)
- Email: contact the repository owner listed on GitHub

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any relevant links, files, or screenshots

You will receive an acknowledgment as soon as possible.

## What Counts as a Security Issue?

Examples include (but are not limited to):
- Malicious content or links added to the documentation
- Supply-chain risks related to build or deployment
- Unsafe commands or instructions that could cause unintended system damage
- Compromised dependencies used in the documentation build process

General documentation mistakes, typos, or unclear explanations **are not security issues** and should be reported via normal GitHub issues.

## Disclosure Policy

Security issues will be investigated and resolved responsibly.  
Public disclosure will occur only after a fix or mitigation is available.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and efforts to keep the community safe.
